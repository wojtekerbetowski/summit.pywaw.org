        <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
        <p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of
          gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).
          We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
          for any conference venue, including talks, parties, Twitter and other online media. Harassment includes offensive
          verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
          religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
          recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Conference participants
          violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion
          of the conference organisers. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any
          other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff.</p>
        <p>Alcohol overdose does not relieve anyone of the responsibility for their actions.</p>
